Cute-Album
==========

I went out hiking with my friend to enjoy the spring time last week. We took a lot of pictures and had a great time. When I come back I want to collect my photographs into an album, add comments to them and organize them into a story board, then I can share it with my friends and leave a good memory. The current Album apps are so boring that I feel a waste of time with them. I want cute animations as if these photographs may talk, I want page curl effect just like what ibook does when I go to next page, I need filter to beautify the pictures. So let's make it happen.
